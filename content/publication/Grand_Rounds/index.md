abstract: "The increasing abundance of ‘omics data (e.g., genetic, metabolomic) holds great potential for advancing research and precision medicine. Already, individuals’ genetic information is being used to inform drug selection and dosing and high-throughput metabolomics is informing precision nutrition. However, challenges in rigorous, reproducible, and representative uses of the data remain. Thoughtful study design, data use, and method development can help address these challenges. This presentation showcases two ‘omics informatics opportunities: detecting and leveraging genetic substructure from summary data, and identifying metabolite derived food biomarkers and their association with health."
