My name is Sakaiza, I did my undergraduate studies at Smith College in Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) and chemistry. I love any combination of numbers and health sciences. I am currently involved in the nutrition projects in the Hendricks team.

I come from Antananarivo, Madagascar. In my free time, I like singing, playing guitar, dancing, painting (Anything Artsy ... I am in!) and my newest hobby is  sleeping.
