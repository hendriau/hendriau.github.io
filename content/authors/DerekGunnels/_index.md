Hello! My name is Derek. I was an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver.

I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a certification/minor in Data Science (Spring 2022) within the two departments. I am originally from South-East Missouri, and I moved to Colorado in the mid-2010's.

When I'm not working on projects, research, aiding students as a teaching assistant, or in classes myself, I'm am likely to be found reading books, playing games, programming for fun, and similar.
