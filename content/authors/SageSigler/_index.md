Greetings! My name is Sage. I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver. I received my BS in Mathematics in 2020 and am currently pursuing my Master's in Statistics. I am from the beautiful city of New Orleans and love any excuse to put on a costume. My other passions include Irish dance (which I've been doing for 13 years now!), bouldering, art, card games, and reading.
