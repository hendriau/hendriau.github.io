Hi! My name is Nikole, I am an undergraduate at University of Colorado Denver in Mathematics with a dual concentration in probability/statistics and data science, graduating Fall 2022. Prior to pursuing mathematics, I completed most of an undergraduate degree in writing. I love using math, data science, and my experience with writing to make important but complex topics accessible to anyone.

Outside of school, I love spending time with my husband and four dogs. I participate in a variety of dog sports, and if I'm not doing homework you can find me having fun in the agility ring with my dogs!
