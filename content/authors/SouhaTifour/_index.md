bio: Hello! My name is Souha. I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver (5 YEAR BS IN MATHEMATICS / MS IN STATISTICSprogram) and I am minoring in Business. I have chosen Mathematics as a major strongly believing that Math is behind all sciences. Then, when I studied Statistics, I started to see how Math can be applied in the real world and I fall in love with it. Besides loving statistics, I adore fashion designing and drawing and I am thinking to follow that passion as well in the future.
Thank you!!
