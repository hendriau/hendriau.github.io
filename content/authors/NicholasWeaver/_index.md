Hello! My name is Nicholas, but most people call me Nick. I was a graduate student in the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver. I received my Master's in Statistics in 2020 and completed my PhD in applied mathematics (Summer 2022) within the department. My research is advised by Dr. Audrey Hendricks and is focused in biostatistics, primarily the integration of multiple omics types for human health. 

I am originally from Pennsylvania and am a huge Philadelphia Eagles and Phillies fan. When I am not at school I am most likely playing volleyball (indoor or grass, never sand), enjoying a board game, watching sports, or hiking.
