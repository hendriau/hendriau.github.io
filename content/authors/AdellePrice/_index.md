Hi all, my name is Adelle and I am a graduate student in the MS in Statistics program at CU Denver. I have a previously earned BS in Biochemistry and it has been exciting combining mathematical and genetic concepts while working on the Summix project in Dr. Hendricks lab. 

Outside of research and school, I am an avid Latin dancer and mountain biker. I also love to hike and go on road trips with my dog Max!
