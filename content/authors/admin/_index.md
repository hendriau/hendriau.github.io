Dr. Hendricks is a statistical geneticist and biostatistician interested in the complex nature of human diseases and traits.  Her research spans a variety of health and disease projects including work in large scale genetic, methylation, metabolomic, and expression studies as well as more focused functional and model organism research. Recent applied and collaborative projects include understanding the mechanisms and mediators behind successful nutrition interventions in children and adults. Dr. Hendricksâ€™s recent methodological work focuses on developing methods and user-friendly software to increase the utility and equity of publicly available genetic data, especially for diverse and under-represented ancestral populations. Dr. Hendricks is proud to have an active and dynamic research group mentoring amazing undergraduate and graduate students.
