The Hendricksâ€™s team mission is to be the lynch pin between biomedical research and statistical and machine learning method development. Sitting at the interface between the applied and the theoretical enables our team to develop and apply methods to improve the utility and equity of large, publicly available genetic data resources, identify the biological mechanisms of healthy diets, and elucidate the genomic underpinnings of conditions and traits. We follow best practices of reproducibility and robust science by creating open source, well documented software and releasing all data and code used for our studies. Our team is highly collaborative working with people from a variety of backgrounds and education levels. We are always learning, improving, and pushing ourselves and others to be our best. In doing so, we produce first-class research for the broader community and train the next generation of genomics and health data scientists.
