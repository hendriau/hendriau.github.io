**Post Doctoral Fellow in Statistical Genetics and Genomics** 
I am hiring a two-year, renewable post-doctoral fellow to develop and apply statistical methods to increase the utility and equity of large scale, publicly available genetic data as part of my recent NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award. The main projects consist of, but are not limited to, methods to use common controls and to estimate, adjust, and harness heterogeneity in genetic summary data.
