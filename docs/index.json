However, summarizing individual-level data can mask population structure, resulting in confounding, reduced power, and incorrect prioritization of putative causal variants. This limits the utility of publicly available data, especially for understudied or admixed populations where additional research and resources are most needed. Although several methods exist to estimate ancestry in individual-level data, methods to estimate ancestry proportions in summary data are lacking. Here, we present Summix, a method to efficiently deconvolute ancestry and provide ancestry-adjusted allele frequencies (AFs) from summary data. Using continental reference ancestry, African (AFR), non-Finnish European (EUR), East Asian (EAS), Indigenous American (IAM), South Asian (SAS), we obtain accurate and precise estimates (within 0.1%) for all simulation scenarios. We apply Summix to gnomAD v.2.1 exome and genome groups and subgroups, finding heterogeneous continental ancestry for several groups, including African/African American (∼84% AFR, ∼14% EUR) and American/Latinx (∼4% AFR, ∼5% EAS, ∼43% EUR, ∼46% IAM). Compared to the unadjusted gnomAD AFs, Summix's ancestry-adjusted AFs more closely match respective African and Latinx reference samples. Even on modern, dense panels of summary statistics, Summix yields results in seconds, allowing for estimation of confidence intervals via block bootstrap. Given an accompanying R package, Summix increases the utility and equity of public genetic resources, empowering novel research opportunities.","tags":["Genetics"],"title":"Summix: A method for detecting and adjusting for population structure in genetic summary data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Weaver","Audrey E.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
